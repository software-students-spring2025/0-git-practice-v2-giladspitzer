## Interesting Article on Software Development/Engineering

[**ChatGPT Operator: The iPhone Of Agentic AI, If Done Right**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisromero/2025/01/25/chatgpt-operator-the-iphone-of-agentic-ai-if-done-right/)

I found this article fascinating because it draws a bold comparison between the potential impact of ChatGPT’s operator capabilities and the disruptive influence of the iPhone. Just as the iPhone changed the way we interact with mobile devices -- creating an entire ecosystem of apps -- this new approach to AI could spark a similar revolution. If done right, it could lead to a diverse range of AI-powered tools and services that fundamentally shift how we develop and deploy software.

From a software engineering perspective, the idea of “agentic AI” is particularly compelling. It implies a future where intelligent agents can autonomously handle complex tasks, allowing software architects and developers to design solutions around these AI components rather than just traditional code modules. This shift could mirror the transition from monolithic apps to microservices, but taken to a new level of autonomy and intelligence. It’s an exciting prospect that may open up fresh opportunities for innovation and reshape the entire landscape of software development.
