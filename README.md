# Interesting Article on Software Development/Engineering

[**ChatGPT Operator: The iPhone Of Agentic AI, If Done Right**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisromero/2025/01/25/chatgpt-operator-the-iphone-of-agentic-ai-if-done-right/)

I found this article fascinating because it draws a bold comparison between the potential impact of ChatGPT’s operator capabilities and the disruptive influence of the iPhone. Just as the iPhone changed the way we interact with mobile devices -- creating an entire ecosystem of apps -- this new approach to AI could spark a similar revolution. If done right, it could lead to a diverse range of AI-powered tools and services that fundamentally shift how we develop and deploy software.

From a software engineering perspective, the idea of “agentic AI” is particularly compelling. It implies a future where intelligent agents can autonomously handle complex tasks, allowing software architects and developers to design solutions around these AI components rather than just traditional code modules. This shift could mirror the transition from monolithic apps to microservices, but taken to a new level of autonomy and intelligence. It’s an exciting prospect that may open up fresh opportunities for innovation and reshape the entire landscape of software development.

## Comment from Benjamin DeWeese

Operator appears to be [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and ChatGPT wrapped into one. An example of how this failed in the past was the [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/), who attempted just this. I am skeptical that this will become a widely used tool in the automation world when OpenAI's compute costs are soaring. Sam Altman has [admitted in interviews](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-says-losing-money-080700756.html) that they are losing enormous amounts of money on their newest ChatGPT Pro offering, priced at $200 a month. [Posting on X](https://x.com/sama/status/1876104315296968813), Altman has said "insane thing: we are currently losing money on openai pro subscriptions! people use it much more than we expected.", as well as "i personally chose the price and thought we would make some money". Who would have thought?
